# Music Shop

Angular demo application

Live app at <http://csouza.me/MusicShop/>

## Running the app

Serve `index.html` from a web server.  

I like using `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` because it's simple and it's very  
likely that you already have Python installed, but feel free to use whatever you want.

## Development

Install dependencies with `npm install`.  
In order to compile sass and watch for changes, run `gulp`.
